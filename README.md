# SICP-ExercisesAndCode

![Cover Image](./images/cover.png)

This repository is dedicated to my journey through the renowned computer science book, "***Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs***" (SICP), by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman.

This repo will serve as a collection of my exercises, code snippets, and personal notes as I delve into the depths of this influential work.

## About the Book

"_**Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**_" is a seminal work in computer science, exploring the principles and techniques of software design and programming. The book emphasizes the role of abstraction and the use of Lisp (more specifically, the Scheme dialect) to illustrate fundamental concepts in computer science and software engineering.

## Goals and Objectives

- **Deep Understanding**: To gain a profound understanding of the principles of computer science and software engineering as presented in SICP.
- **Practical Application**: To apply the concepts learned in practical exercises and projects.
- **Continuous Learning**: To document my learning process and reflect on my progress throughout the journey.

## Using LISP, Racket, and `#lang sicp`

For the exercises and code in this repository, I am using:

- **LISP**: A historical and foundational language in computer science, essential for understanding SICP's core concepts.
- **Racket**: A modern dialect of LISP, providing a rich set of features and tools for an enhanced programming experience.
- **#lang sicp**: An extension in Racket specifically designed for SICP, allowing the code to align closely with the book's examples.

### Requirements

To run and use the code from this repository, you will need:

1. **Racket**: Install Racket from [https://racket-lang.org/](https://racket-lang.org/).
2. `#lang sicp Package`: After installing Racket, install the `sicp` package by running `raco pkg install sicp` in your terminal.

With these tools installed, you can clone this repository and experiment with the exercises and code snippets, furthering your understanding of SICP's principles.
