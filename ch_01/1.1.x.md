# Chapter 1 Notes - 01

- Processess manipulate other abstract things called data.
- The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program.
- Well designed computational systems are organized in a modular manner.
  - So **parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately**.
- LISP is useful for studying the principles of programming languages.

## 1.1 The Elements of Programming

- A language is a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes.
- A language provides 3 mechanisms for combining simple ideas into complex ideas:
  - **Primitive Expressions:** the simplest entities the language is concerned with.
  - **Means of combination:** by which compound elements are built from simpler ones.
  - **Means of abstraction:** by which compound elements can be named and manipulated.
- Two kinds of **Elements**
  - **procedures** - description of rules for manipulating data
  - **data** - the "stuff" that we manipulate

## 1.1.1 Expressions

- The interpreter responds by displaying the result of its evaluating an expression
- Expressions representing numbers may be combined with an expression representing a primitive procedure (such as + or \*)

**Example:**

> _The following expressions can be referred to as "**combinations**". A combination is an expression that consists of applying a function to some arguments_
>
> `(<operator> <operand> <operand>)`

```
(+ 33 33)
(- 33 33)
(* 33 33)
(/ 33 33)
(+ 3.3 3.3)
```

- The convention of placing the operator to the left is called _prefix notation_
  - Prefix notation is useful because it can take an arbitrary number of arguments: `(+ 8 6 7 5 3 0 9)`
  - It extends in a straight forward way to allow combinations to be nested.
    - Can have combinations whose elements are themselves combinations: `(+ (* 3 3) (- 33 3))`
    - In principle there is no limit to the depth of such nested combinations.
- **Pretty Printing:** Aligning the operands vertically.
  - Indentations clearly displaying structure
- Basic **Interpreter** cycle:
  - read-eval-print loop (REPL)

## 1.1.2 Naming and Environment

- A critical aspect of programming language is using a name to refer to a computational object.
- A **name** identifies a variable whose value is the object.
- Things are named with the `define` keyword in the _Scheme_ dialect of Lisp: `define size 2`
  - `define` is the language's simplest means of abstraction.
    - Allows for simple names to refer to the results of compound operations.
- These name-object associations are stored in memory.
  - This memory is called the **global environment**
- Computation may involve a number of different environments.

## 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations

- Isolating issues and thinking procedurally.
  - The interpreter is following a procedure.

> **Combinations in Lisp**
>
> 1.  **Basic Structure** : A combination in Lisp is written in the form of a list enclosed in parentheses. The first element of the list is typically a function or an operator, and the subsequent elements are the arguments to that function or operator.
> 2.  **Evaluation Rule** : To evaluate a combination, Lisp follows a specific set of rules. First, it evaluates each of the elements of the combination. Then, it applies the function (the first element) to the results of the evaluated arguments (the other elements).
> 3.  **Recursive Nature** : Combinations can be nested within each other. This means that an argument to a function can itself be a combination, which needs to be evaluated following the same rules.
> 4.  **Example** : A simple combination in Lisp might look like this: `(+ 1 2)`. This expression represents a combination where the `+` function is applied to the arguments `1` and `2`. The result of this combination is the sum of `1` and `2`, which is `3`.
> 5.  **Function Definitions and Calls** : In Lisp, functions are also defined using combinations. The arguments to the function and the body of the function are specified in a list structure, following the Lisp syntax.
> 6.  **SICP Context** : In the context of SICP, combinations are fundamental to understanding how Lisp programs are structured and evaluated. The book uses combinations to illustrate key programming concepts like recursion, higher-order functions, and the evaluation model of Lisp.
